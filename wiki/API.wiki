= Introduction =

Communication with the poker server happens through a HTTP connection. 

|| *HTTP methods:* || PUT || GET || POST || DELETE ||
|| *CRUD operation:* || CREATE || READ || UPDATE || DELETE ||

The [http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html REST]-style architecture uses all the built-in features of HTTP such as caching, authentication and error codes.

= Authentication =
There is no explicit login functionality. The client can ask the user for credentials and then try to access the [PingAPI /ping/] page with basic authentication headers set to see if they are accepted. In every following request those same headers must be included.
